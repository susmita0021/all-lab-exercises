Coca-Cola is the most popular soft drink in the world. It’s sold almost everywhere, and its brand name is known in most languages. 

The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC) manufactures and sells not only Coca-Cola itself, but also a wide range of other beverages, like Fanta, Sprite, water, juices, and energy drinks. The brand owes its success primarily to the product itself as well as its iconic marketing campaigns that position Coke as a drink with a fun and active lifestyle.

But there’s one factor a person might miss when explaining the wildly successful product: the Coca-Cola supply chain is one of the most wide-reaching, seamless operations in the world.
Before we start talking about the Coca-Cola supply chain, let’s take a look at the key milestones in the history of this legendary drink.

In 1886, Dr. John Pemberton, a pharmacist in Atlanta, invented a flavored syrup mixed with carbonated water. At those times, there was a belief that carbonated water had a good impact on health, so Coca-Cola was actually sold as a medicine at soda fountains.
In 1888, Dr. Pemberton sold his business to Atlanta businessman, Asa G. Candler., who expanded the beverage sales to soda fountains beyond Atlanta.
In 1894, Joseph Biedenharn was the first to start selling Coca-Cola in bottles.
In 1899, three enterprising businessmen in Tennessee got exclusive rights to bottle and sell Coca-Cola, thus starting the company’s worldwide bottling system.
In 1929, the first Coca-Cola slogan, “The Pause That Refreshes,” appeared in the Saturday Evening Post.
In 1977, the contoured Coca-Cola bottle was trademarked, and the first marketing efforts were made, which then turned Coca-Cola into the world’s most well-known beverage brand.

Coca Cola’s VP of Customer Logistics Wendy Manning once said the company is able to deliver a drink from a factory to a local store within 48 hours. The secret behind this impressive figure is local sourcing, meaning that most of the drinks are manufactured directly in the country where they are sold.

Coca-Cola has more than 900 bottling and manufacturing facilities across the world, and its factories have some of the world’s fastest production lines. It’s not just about the sheer number of facilities, though.
The Coca-Cola Company headquarters in Atlanta manufacture the concentrated syrup and sell it to Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) or another bottling partner, which is responsible for selling the product in North America and Canada.
The bottling partner sends it to a manufacturing facility, which mixes the syrup with other ingredients, such as filtered water and sweeteners. After that, the bottler packages the final product and distributes it to retail partners (stores, restaurants, vending machines, etc.)
The Coca-Cola Export Corporation (TCCEC) partners with local bottlers across the world and distributes the drink to the corresponding local markets.

Logistics is an integral part of any supply chain, and Coca-Cola’s logistics expertise definitely contributes to its supply chain success. Here are some of the logistics-related best practices implemented by Coca-Cola:

Manufacturing products on a more frequent basis, e.g. once a week
Implementing weekly meetings between the teams worldwide
Moving the production plants closer to customers
Introducing daily interaction between the main sites
Introducing seamless processes that are shared between all supply chain participants
Does Coke’s Supply Chain Management Inspire You?
Coca-Cola’s manufacturing and supply chain management have inspired a lot of other businesses to be better.

But businesses today can scale growth at a much faster rate than you could back in the early 1990s thanks to new software and automation techniques. The takeaway here should be that the principles Coca-Cola grew from still apply, even if the technology that facilitated that growth is outmoded. 

If you’re looking to speed your growth, consider trying out some inventory management software to help your production and supply chain become more efficient. Check out Dynamic Inventory’s key features and contact us today to schedule a live demo and see what we can offer. </p>

Sprite is a colorless, lemon and lime-flavored soft drink created by The Coca-Cola Company. It was first developed in West Germany in 1959 as Fanta Klare Zitrone ("Clear Lemon Fanta") and was introduced in the United States under the current brand name Sprite in 1961 as a competitor to 7 Up. Sprite comes in multiple flavours, including cranberry, cherry, grape, orange, and vanilla.

Sprite advertising often makes use of the portmanteau word lymon, a combination of the words "lemon" and "lime".Additionally, the bottle of the beverage has several concave spots, an attempt to emulate the bubbles caused by the soda's carbonation.

By the 1980s, Sprite had developed a large following among teenagers. In response, Sprite began to cater to this demographic in their advertisements in 1987. "I Like the Sprite In You" was the brand's first long-running slogan, and many jingles were produced around it before its discontinuation in 1994.

In 1993, Marketing agency Lowe and Partners created a new and slogan, "Control your thirst" upon commission from The Coca-Cola Company. The new, more vibrant logo stood out more on packaging and featured a blue-to-green gradient with silver "splashes" and subtle white "bubbles" in the background. The product name, "Sprite" had a blue backdrop shadow on the logo. The words; "Great Lymon Taste!" which had been present on the previous logo, were removed. This logo was used in the United States until 2006, and similar variants were used in other countries until this year as well. </p>
